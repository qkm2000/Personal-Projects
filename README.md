This repo is a space for me to build games and other personal projects. Do let me know if there's anything that would be cool to build!

All the projects so far will likely require pygame, so here's how to install it
- Open a terminal and run `pip install pygame`
- If that fails, try `pip3 install pygame`
Any other special requirements will be stated in the folders' readmes, so do refer to that to see if you will require any more packages

Thanks! :)
